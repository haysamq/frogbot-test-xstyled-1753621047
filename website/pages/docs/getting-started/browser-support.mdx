# Browser Support

Understanding which browsers xstyled supports and how to manage vendor prefixes.

<carbon-ad />

xstyled is compatible with all modern browsers, in fact [all browsers that support CSS variables](https://caniuse.com/css-variables).

Certain features such as `focusVisible` are included but not supported natively by all modern browsers. We've included information about recommended polyfills for those features directly alongside the documentation for the features themselves.

[styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) both automatically add prefixes in your CSS without any additional configuration.
