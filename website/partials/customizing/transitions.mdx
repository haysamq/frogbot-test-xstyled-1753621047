### Transitions

If you'd like to customize your values for transitions, use the `theme.transitions` section of your theme.

```diffjs
  // theme.js

  export const theme = {
    transitions: {
      // ...
+     light: 'color 300ms ease-in-out'
    },
  }
```

If you don't want to customize it, a set of `transitions` is already present in default theme. Values are the same as the values accepted in `transitionProperty`.
